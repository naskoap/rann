### Project Topic:

Tool comparison â€“ *Optuna* vs. *Hyperopt*

Optuna and Hyperopt are two Python-based tools designed to help with the step of __parameter optimization__ in a machine learning pipeline. Both have UI features that allow users to compare the performance of different parameter combinations, and both integrate with standard Python ML libraries, including `scikit-learn` and `Tensorflow`.

Official resources for Optuna and Hyperopt are provided below:

#### Optuna:

- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/optuna/optuna

- Website (includes documentation and tutorials): https://optuna.org

#### Hyperopt:

- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt

- Documentation: http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/

#### Other Resources:

Users have tried these tools and written tutorials and summaries of their experiences. Some of this un-official work is linked below:

- Research paper on comparative study of optimization tools: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06433.pdf


### Repository Structure

In this project, we conduct a code analysis of both tools above, as well as an experiment (in Python) to test their performance. 

The written documentation summarizing the code review and experiment results can be found in the `/report` folder, while the `/experiment` folder contains the Python code used to conduct the experiment.
